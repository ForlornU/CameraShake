# CameraShake

![alt text](https://github.com/ForlornU/Images/blob/main/CamShakeThumbnail.png)

A camera-shake script for unity3d

Contains 2 script
- CameraShake
- ExampleTrigger

CameraShake.cs goes on your camera, I suggest parenting the camera to an empty game object and zeroing its transform values
ExampleTrigger.cs Can be attached to any other object, the closer that object is, the stronger it will shake the camera
